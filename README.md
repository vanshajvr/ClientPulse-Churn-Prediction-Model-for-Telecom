# ðŸ§  Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹  
This project is all about predicting **customer churn** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. It's a classic problem in the business world â€” figuring out which customers are likely to leave â€” and I tackled it using deep learning with a clean accuracy of **84.95%** on the test set! ðŸ”¥

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This project dives into how neural networks can help solve real-world business problems. I used the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** and built an ANN from scratch using **Keras**.

But here's the twist â€” this wasn't a smooth, linear path.  
Keras was completely new to me, and understanding how layers, activations, and compilation worked was a whole mini-mission. ðŸ˜…  
Whenever I got stuck (which was... often ðŸ‘€), I took a moment to **learn** and then added a markdown cell in the notebook to explain it â€” for future me and for anyone else reading it.

## ðŸš€ What I Did

âœ… Preprocessed and cleaned the data  
âœ… Handled missing values and encoded categorical features  
âœ… Built a neural network using **Keras (TensorFlow backend)**  
âœ… Trained it with proper loss functions and optimizers  
âœ… Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
âœ… Explained complex concepts in markdown while learning (makes the notebook beginner-friendly!)
