# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

Hey folks! 👋  
This project is all about predicting **customer churn** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. It's a classic problem in the business world — figuring out which customers are likely to leave — and I tackled it using deep learning with a clean accuracy of **84.95%** on the test set! 🔥

## 📌 About the Project

This project dives into how neural networks can help solve real-world business problems. I used the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** and built an ANN from scratch using **Keras**.

But here's the twist — this wasn't a smooth, linear path.  
Keras was completely new to me, and understanding how layers, activations, and compilation worked was a whole mini-mission. 😅  
Whenever I got stuck (which was... often 👀), I took a moment to **learn** and then added a markdown cell in the notebook to explain it — for future me and for anyone else reading it.

## 🚀 What I Did

✅ Preprocessed and cleaned the data  
✅ Handled missing values and encoded categorical features  
✅ Built a neural network using **Keras (TensorFlow backend)**  
✅ Trained it with proper loss functions and optimizers  
✅ Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
✅ Explained complex concepts in markdown while learning (makes the notebook beginner-friendly!)

## ⚔️ Challenges Faced

- Understanding how Keras works — especially layers, activation functions, and optimizers
- Making sure my inputs matched expected ANN input formats
- Interpreting evaluation metrics beyond just accuracy
- Keeping the notebook beginner-friendly — every time I learned something new, I broke it down right there in the code to teach it to myself and the reader

## 📈 What’s Next?

- Try logistic regression, SVM, or Random Forest and compare results  
- Deploy the ANN using Streamlit or Flask  
- Make a dashboard to visualize churn insights interactively  
- Add SHAP or LIME to explain predictions (model interpretability FTW!)

## 🌟 Final Thoughts

This was more than just a machine learning project — it was a deep dive into how *real-world problems meet technical curiosity.*  
And yes, the debugging sessions were long, the errors cryptic, and Keras at times felt like learning a foreign language...  
But by sticking through and teaching myself *as I went*, I walked out of this project with much more than code — I gained clarity.

More projects and stories coming soon. ✨
